# Model-View-Controller-Lab

These two project files contains a simpe code that showcases the working of ModeViewController Pattern.
This pattern divided the system into three components
1.Model    2. View   3.Controller
Model stores and retrieve data
View act as a UI interface that shows data to the users.
Controller is the intermediatery that handle request( send and recieve requests).
Thanks!
